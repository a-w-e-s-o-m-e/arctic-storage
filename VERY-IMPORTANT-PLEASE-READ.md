Hello Dear Internet Archive Historian,

This file was created on the 2nd of February 2020. I don't know in which year you'll be reading this message, but I'd like to let you know that the fact that you are reading this message, really impresses me.

Maybe it's 2234 or 3400, but yet you are still reading this piece of useless file :)

A little bit more about our culture. We have 2 legs, 2 arms, 2 eyes. We lost our tails around 30 million years ago, but yet my colleagues still keep the door open when they enter the office. Currently, we use Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Telegram, Signal, Google, Twitter and other socials like that.

Best regards,

an ancient commit...
